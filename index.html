						For my final project I have chosen the ‘researcher’ project type. This final paper will try to determine if there is a correlation between socioeconomic status and prevalence and proximity to green space (parks, forests, etc…) in Montreal. I plan to incorporate the entirety of the island of Montreal as the study area and focus on visually representing the findings. This is an important topic as there is a well documented relationship between acessability to nature -and outdoor activites- and humam health and well being (both mental and physical). The results of this paper hope to highlight areas of Montreal that could benefit from investment in green space.

						This project will require at least the folllwing data: <br>
						<li>Island of Montreal Census Tracts (Potentially DAs as well)</li>
						<li>Land use data </a></li>
						<li>Population and socioeconomic status indicators (median household income, education levels, family size)</a></li>
						<li id='splash-list4'>Experiment with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size" target="_blank">font-size units</a> px, %, em, calc, etc.</li>
						<li id='splash-list5'>It is worth reading up on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout" target="_blank">CSS grid layout</a> since the current page is structured that way. This is relatively new to CSS and allows you to easily structure webpages without external libraries such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">Flexbox</a>, etc. CSS grid layout may appear complicated to many, so take your time with it.</li>
						<li id='splash-list6'>I will add more tips and links during the lab based on questions..</li>
						<li id='splash-list7'>Final note: you don't need to become a pro at this, but be aware that knowing the ins and outs of HTML and CSS is fundamental to basic web design. You can, however, get away with not knowing much if, for example, you are more focused on embedded webmaps, which we will get to next week and which are styled differently. Still, the bones that hold everything together are what you see right in front of you!</li>
